### Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on variational quantum algorithms for finding excited states using implicit deflation techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA), Grover's algorithm, and their applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on quantum optimization and quantum machine learning projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my open source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything quantum optimization related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at raijeku@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning in general, be it languages, physics or just interesting stuff.

### Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimizing pulses on IBM quantum devices, analyzing my quantum k-means implementation and constellation modulation. I'm also working on my personal website!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning japanese and constellation diagrams in optics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on quantum machine learning and quantum benchmarking projects. Classical machine learning application projects too.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a job as a developer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything math or quantum related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at raijeku@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning in general, be it languages, physics or just interesting stuff.
